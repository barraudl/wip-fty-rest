This is a skeleton document created by zproject, which will not be
regenerated automatically (by Makefiles nor project.xml re-parsing).
You should add hand-written text here to detail whatever applies to
Linux standard manpage Section 7 (note that other OSes may follow
a different standard with similar concepts, and extend the recipes
to package this document into a different section number):

    Overviews or descriptions of various topics, conventions
    and protocols, character set standards, the standard
    filesystem layout, and miscellaneous other things.

pages generated for public classes during build with contents taken
from source code comments.
